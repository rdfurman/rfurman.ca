# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions - you can change the name to be more reflective of your Action

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push request events but only for the main branch
  push:
    branches: [master]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

  # Allows A Webhook to be called which will run the Action. Use this for example from WordPress with the GatsbyJS plugin.
  repository_dispatch:
    types: [publish_blog]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
